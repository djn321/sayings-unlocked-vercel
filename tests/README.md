# Test Suite Documentation

This directory contains automated tests for the Sayings Unlocked application.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit & Integration Tests (`tests/edge-functions.test.ts`)

Tests for edge function logic and database interactions. These verify:
- Subscription flow (create, confirm)
- Feedback recording
- Unsubscribe functionality
- Security (token validation, RLS policies)
- Error handling

### 2. Component Tests (`src/components/__tests__/`)

React component tests using Vitest and React Testing Library:
- SubscriptionForm validation
- Form submission handling
- Error states
- Loading states

### 3. Smoke Tests (`tests/smoke-tests.sh`)

Production health checks that verify:
- All edge function endpoints are reachable
- Security measures are in place (invalid tokens rejected)
- Frontend pages load correctly

## Running Tests

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run all unit tests once
bun test

# Run tests in watch mode (auto-rerun on file changes)
bun test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
bun test:coverage

# Open interactive test UI
bun test:ui

# Run smoke tests against production
bun smoke-test
```

### CI/CD

Tests run automatically on:
- Every push to main branch
- Every pull request
- Before deployment

GitHub Actions workflows:
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Unit, integration, and smoke tests
- `.github/workflows/deploy-supabase.yml` - Deployment pipeline

```

## Writing New Tests

### Unit Tests

Create test files next to the code they test with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should do something', () => {
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Component Tests

```typescript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { MyComponent } from '../MyComponent';

it('should render correctly', () => {
  render(<MyComponent />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Hello')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## Regression Testing Strategy

Critical flows covered:
1. **Subscription Flow** - New user signs up and confirms email
2. **Feedback** - User clicks like/dislike on etymology
3. **Unsubscribe** - User unsubscribes from emails
4. **Security** - Token validation, CORS, RLS policies

Any changes to these flows should have corresponding tests updated.

## Coverage Goals

- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage
- **Edge functions**: 80%+ coverage
- **Components**: 70%+ coverage
- **Overall**: 60%+ coverage

View coverage report: `bun test:coverage` then open `coverage/index.html`

## Troubleshooting

### Tests fail locally but pass in CI
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure you're using the same Node/Bun version as CI

### Smoke tests fail
- Check if production services are down
- Verify SUPABASE_URL and SITE_URL are correct
- Check if edge functions are deployed

### Component tests fail
- Clear test cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vitest`
- Reinstall dependencies: `bun install`

## Best Practices

1. **Keep tests fast** - Mock external dependencies
2. **Test behaviour, not implementation** - Focus on what users see/do
3. **One assertion per test** - Makes failures easy to diagnose
4. **Descriptive test names** - Should read like documentation
5. **Arrange-Act-Assert** - Clear test structure

## Continuous Improvement

When bugs are found:
1. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Fix the bug
3. Verify the test now passes
4. Commit both test and fix together

This ensures the bug doesn't regress in the future.
